# Synonym Rolls - Just Like Grammar Used to Make

This project is just a fun way of displaying the results of a fetch to Datamuse API to get back 6 synonyms from the entered work.

## Demo
Enter a word in the search bar and press enter/click the submit button. See the results as 6 synonyms returned by the API.

## Local Setup
Simply open your terminal up to the root of the project and run 'yarn && yarn start'. Then open the browser to the localhost address displayed.
